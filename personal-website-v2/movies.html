				<td>
					<h1>Lord Of The Rings</h1>
					<h3>
						Lord of The Rings is like The Hobbit but this time it's about destroying the ring because the darkness 
						has been awaken and has been spreading. The Ring has a will of its own and it wants to go back to his former 
						master who is the king of the darkness. If that happens the world is at stake. That's why the main chracter
						here and his companions must destroy the ring and to do that they must travel to the base of the enemy.
						From there, there is a volcano and they must drop the ring there to be destoryed forever.
						The main character here is the grand son of Bilbo and goes by the name Frodo.
					</h3>

				<td><img class="content-image" src="images/sonic.jpg"></td>
				<td>
					<h1>Sonic The Hedgehog</h1>
					<h3>
						This movie is about a hedgehog that can run like crazy, faster than the speed of sound.
						He is from another dimension and someone is going after him so, he has to keep running.
						But then, his ring which can be used as a portal teleported him to Earth. Too bad, on Earth people 
						are hunting him because they think that he is dangerous and there is another one, a guy who hunts him because he
						wants his power.

			<tr>
				<td><img class="content-image" src="images/HarryPotter.jpg"></td>
				<td>
					<h1>Harry Potter</h1>
					<h3>
						Magic is on top of my favorite list and I see magic and mystical creatures in Harry Potter. I like how Harry becomes strong

					</h3>
				</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td><img class="content-image" src="images/Narnia.jpg"></td>
				<td>
					<h1>The Chronicles of Narnia</h1>
					<h3>
						Narnia is one of my favorite movies because there are a lot of fighting, magic and I get to see mystical creatures, 
						not to mention that the animals are talking like humans. Narnia is in a different dimension and time there runs
						faster than the real world, so you can age there fast. My favorite character there is Aslan the lion.
