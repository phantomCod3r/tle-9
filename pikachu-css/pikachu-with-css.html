<h1><img src="pikachu.png"><br>A New Side of Pikachu</h1>

<div class="styleforp-">
	<p>You’ve never seen a <span class="highlights">Pikachu</span> like this one before. Fancying himself a real detective, this <span class="highlights01">Pikachu</span> is gruff and never far from a hot cup of coffee. He’s also a big talker who considers himself to be among the best of the best!
	</p>
	<p>This bossy <span class="highlights">Pikachu</span> has the attitude of a stern, middle-aged man, which he’ll make abundantly clear to you throughout the game. Look forward to hearing his catchphrase “A bolt of brilliance!” as often as possible.</p>
</div>

<div class="styleforp-2">
<p>It’s not just his ability to speak or his attitude that sets this <span class="highlights01">Pikachu</span> apart from other <span class="highlights">Pikachu</span> you’ve seen. He loves to laugh and to solve mysteries, and he’ll show you just how exasperated he can get if you blunder through your next case.
</p>

<p>Not to mention that detective hat—a bit of a giveaway that he’s eager to look the part, too!</p>
</div>

<h2>Livin’ in the City</h2>
<p class="styleforp-3">Ryme City: This thriving metropolis is the ideal place for people and Pokémon to live in harmony. But strange things must be simmering under the surface to justify the immense investigative power that you and <span class="highlights01">Pikachu</span> bring to the scene. What could be going on in the shadows of such a beautiful place?
</p>

<h2>Pikachu and You</h2>
<p class="styleforp-4"><span class="highlights">Pikachu</span> isn’t alone in his missions in Ryme City. He’ll be traveling with a young fellow by the name of Tim Goodman...and that’s you. You’ve just hit town to look for your missing father, Detective Harry Goodman, and it doesn’t take long for you to get caught up in the whirlwind of the big city. Like your old man, you’re sharp as a tack. And by the way, you’re the only one who can understand the speech of the <span class="highlights01">Pikachu</span> at your side.
</p>

<h2>Welcome to the Neighborhood</h2>
<p><span class="endstyle">It seems like everyone you cross</span> <span class="endstyle-1">paths with in Ryme City has</span><br><span class="endstyle">a story to tell. And to get to</span> <span class="endstyle-1">the bottom of your investigation,</span><br><span class="endstyle">you’ll need to hear them all</span> <span class="endstyle-1">out. Let’s meet some of the people</span><br><span class="endstyle">you’ll spend time with as</span> <span class="endstyle-1">your investigations progress.</span>
